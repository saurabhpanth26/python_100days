Python Comments 
A comment is a part  of the coding file that the programer does not want to execute, rather the programer uses it to either expalin a block of code or to aviod the execution of a specific part of code while testing.

Single-line comments:
to write a comment just add a '#' at the start of the line.

Multi-Line commets:
To write multi-line comments you can use '#' at each line or you can use the multi line string.
or
you can use this """ at start or at the end """


Escape Sequence Characters

To insert Characters that cannot be directly used in a string, we use an escape Sequence character.

An escape Sequence character is a blackslash '\' followed by the character you want to insert.

More on a Print Statement 

The syntax of a print statement looks something like this 
print(object(s), spe=separartor, end=end, file=file, flush=flush)

1. object - Any Object, and as many as you like. Will be converted to string before printed.
2. Sep= 'separartor': Specify how to separate the objects, if there is more than one. Default is ''
3. end='end': Specify what to print at the end. Default is '\n' (line feed) 
4. file: An object with a write method. Deafult is sys. stdout.
