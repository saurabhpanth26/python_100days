Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programing  and tell computers to do what we are very slow at computation. If i ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediatly say 11. How about 34234235234 X 234234 ?
You will start searching for a calulator or jumo to new tab to calculate the same.
