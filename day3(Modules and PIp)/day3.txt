Day3 - Modules and pip in Python!
Module is like a code which can be used to borrow the code written by somedbody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python.
1. Built in Modules :- These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interperter. There is no need to install such modules explicitly.
2. External Modules :- These moudles are imported from third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.
